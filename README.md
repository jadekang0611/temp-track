# What is TemperTrac

Using this application an education center teacher (e-Haebeob) can input and track students' temperatures once checked to follow the government's regulation in relation to the current situation. This app essentially replaces the current tracking style at many branches where teachers manually write on papers.

## User Research

### Who are main users?

Main users are educators or owners at private institutions mainly eHabeob Math centers.

### Background of the Application

Due to unchanging severity of the COVID-19, Korean government requires every business to take visitors' or customers' personal information and temperatures and maintain all records. Many businesses have devices to capture a customer's QR code to get their personal information from their phone via Kakao or Naver; however, small private institutions can't afford a such device and their students (10 years old to 16 years old) don't have access to their smartphones. Therefore, educators at many institutions take each student's temperature, manually track their personal information and temperatures on papers everyday. Furthermore, they often use the same paper that has previous information of many students over two or three days, each student's personal information is accessible to anyone.

### What are the users' pain points?

Manual entries of each student's temperature takes time and gets lost though government officials often request institutions to send them a compiled report that shows all entries during over a certain period.

### What solutions do the users get from the application?

The users now have one place where they add, view, and edit student's personal information. Therefore, now the users simply enter each student's temperature during their attedence in the class that only takes less than 5 seconds per student. Moreover, each temperature submission never appears in front of public users as the data is saved and input fields are reset. Lastly, the users can now easily share students' temperature records with government officials at request with just one-click.

<!-- ### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
